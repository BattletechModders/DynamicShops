new shopdefs format

There is two types of ShopDefs - normal(used for system shop and black market) and faction(use for faction shops)

there are can be one or multiply shopdefs in one json.
{
	"conditions" : { "tag" : "planet_civ_primitive" },
	"items" : "RT_standard_Miniscule"
}
multiply surrounded by []
[
	{
		"conditions" : { "tag" : "planet_civ_primitive" },
		"items" : "RT_standard_Miniscule"
	},
	{
		"conditions" : { "tag" : "planet_other_gamesworld" },
		"items" : ["RT_List_Solaris", "RT_standard_Miniscule"]
	},
	...
]

Format of shopdef
	{
		"conditions" : list of conditions
		"items" : one or [list] of itemcollections
	}
"conditions" is list of condtions to check
each consist of pair "type" : "value"
avaliable conditions are

"tag" : "tag1,!tag2" - true if each of tag1 present and each of tag2 not present in system
"owner" : "faction1,!faction2" - check if system owner is one of faction1 and none of faction2. faction can be faction short name or generic
"rep" : "value1,>value2,<value3" - check if reputation to system owner is equal to value1, more then value2 or less then value3(if few values given AND operation used)
"piraterep" : "value1,>value2,<value3" - same for pirate reputation. values are SimGameReputation(not case sensivity)
	public enum SimGameReputation
    {
        LOATHED = -3,
        HATED = -2,
        DISLIKED = -1,
        INDIFFERENT = 0,
        LIKED = 1,
        FRIENDLY = 2,
        HONORED = 3,
        ALLIED = 3
    }
"mrb" : "value1,>value2,<value3" - same for mrb rating. values is integer

Format of faction shop def
	{
		"factions" : one or [list] of factions
		"conditions" : list of conditions
		"items" : one or [list] of itemcollections
	}
	
"Generic" Factions
generic factions is list of factions, can be used to unite lot of factions into one to shorter factions lists 
you can set generic faction in mod.json :
		
		"GenericFactions": [
			{
				"Name": "Clans",
				"Members": [
					"ClanBurrock",
					"ClanWolf",
					"ClanCloudCobra",
					"ClanCoyote",
					"ClanDiamondShark",
					"ClansGeneric",
					"ClanFireMandrill",
					"ClanGhostBear",
					"ClanGoliathScorpion",
					"ClanHellsHorses",
					"ClanIceHellion",
					"ClanJadeFalcon",
					"ClanNovaCat",
					"ClanSmokeJaguar",
					"ClanSnowRaven",
					"ClanStarAdder",
					"ClanSteelViper"
				]
			}
		]
this for example make new generic faction "Clans" which can be used anywhere in shopdefs where faction required
